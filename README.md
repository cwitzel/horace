Journey to designing and personalising my own hexabot, using other fantastic projects as a launchpad.

## Why?
I am always searching for personal projects that can teach me new skills while providing creative fulfillment.
The idea of creating and personalising my own little hexabot is incredibly exciting to me, as are the principles and techniques involved.
I have worked with microcontrollers and robotics before, but never in a personal, ground-up context. Learning about inverse kinematics and the fundamentals of robotics design really holds my interest.

## What?
I have always loved miniturization, sometimes to my own detriment! Turns out some things just need to be big... I want to design a micro-servo based design similar to [this Spider Robot](https://emilien.ca/Spider-Robot/). All hexapod robots fall within the same basic design parameters, but I want to make it my own. 
I want to implement:
- Lifting from [this incredible hexapod design], touch sensors on the appendages.
- an led matrix display to add personality
- potential ultrasonic sensor to allow for limited autonomous operation
- If I end up using an android phone as the controller, I would be interested in investigating applying machine learning to add personality to the bot.
